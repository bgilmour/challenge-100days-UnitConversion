# UnitConversion

This is my solution to the UnitConversion challenge project from day 19 of the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It supports conversion of lengths, temperatures, and times and offers several input / output units for each conversion type.
